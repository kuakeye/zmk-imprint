# Flashing the firmware to your Cyboard
1. GitHub will automatically run an Action to build your firmware. this takes approximately 2 minutes for most changes.
2. Once the Action is successful, there will be a firmware Artifact in the Action which you can download and unzip.
3. Connect the "central" (left) half of your Cyboard to your computer via USB.
4. Put your Cyboard in bootloader mode by double tapping the reset button next to the USB C port. Pro Tip:  The keycap puller that comes with your Cyboard will fit in the reset hole!
5. Copy the .uf2 file into the USB device named `ASSIMILATOR`.
6. You're done! You can now disconnect your Cyboard from your computer.

# Hardware Notes for Older nice!nano Versions:
To enter bootloader mode, double tap the reset button on the back of your Cyboard.
The battery switch is a physical disconnect switch, so your battery **will not charge** if the switch is off (away from the USB port).  The switch is intended as a way to disconnect the battery for travel to avoid accidental keypresses that would drain the battery while it is in your bag.  For most other times, it can just be left connected (towards the USB port), and your Cyboard will sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity to conserve battery.
